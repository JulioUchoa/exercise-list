CS50 Course Exercises
Welcome to my collection of exercises completed as part of Harvard's CS50 course on computer science, which I took in 2022. 
This course covered a broad range of foundational topics, from programming basics to data structures and algorithms,
and this repository contains the code I wrote while working through each section.

About the Course
CS50 is an introductory computer science course that focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects of computing. 
It begins with C programming and moves through various topics such as memory management, algorithms, web programming, and more. 
The exercises included here reflect the progression of skills and concepts learned along the way.


Why I Took CS50
I took CS50 to gain a solid foundation in computer science principles, as I was looking to deepen my understanding of how computers work under the hood.
The course challenged me to think critically, solve complex problems, and develop a structured approach to coding.

Notes
Feel free to browse through the exercises, and if youâ€™re currently working on CS50 yourself, I encourage you to try the problems on your own before comparing solutions. 
CS50 encourages hands-on learning and critical thinking, so tackling each exercise independently will be invaluable.

Thanks for checking out my CS50 journey!
